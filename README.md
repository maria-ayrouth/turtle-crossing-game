# turtle-crossing-game

you might've played crossy road. so yhis a similar concept. we have a whole bunch of cars going across a super busy multi-lane highway and our turtle is the player who has to cross the road.

this is what the gameplay looks like , the player controls the turtle wich can only go forwards ,and  there's a whole bunch of randomly generated cars wich are going horizontally across the screen .

once the player reaches the other side of the screen , the cars speed up but the player goes back to the starting position ready to cross the screen again.at some point when the player turtle hits a car then that is game over.
